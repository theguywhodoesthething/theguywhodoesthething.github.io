    <h4>When to use = or == or .equals()</h4>
		<p>
				In Java, when assigning a value to a variable, the '=' symbol is used for
				all data types. For example, if you have an 'int' that you've named <strong>age</strong>,
				you may want to assign a value to it. To do this, you use the '=' symbol.
				<strong>int age = 34;</strong> It also works for strings. For example:
				<strong>string name = "Matt";</strong> This is the only time '=' is used, when assigning
				a value to a variable.
		</p>
		<p>
			Likewise, the '==' symbol is only used for comparing two values, either 'int', 'double', or 'boolean'.
			This is used
			closer to how an equal sign is more typically used, in that it evaluates whether the
			expressions on the left and on the right side of the '==' are in fact equal. When the expressions
			are equal, the symbol will evaluate to 'true'. If not, it will evaluate to 'false'.
			For example the expression <strong>2 == 2</strong> is 'true'. So is <strong>2 ==
				1 + 1</strong>. However <strong>2 == 3</strong> is 'false'. The "==" can be used to evaluate
				any containing 'int', 'double', or 'boolean' data types, but not strings. This is a very
				useful tool when creating loops and conditions.
			<p>
				Finally, the .equals() method is used to compare two strings. It essentially works the
				same way as the "==" operator but is specifically used for string variables. For example
				If you want to see if a user input 'Yes' from the keyboard, you could store that input to
				a string <strong>(string answer;)</strong>, then use .equals() to see if his answer matches.
				<strong>answer.equals("Yes")</strong>. The .equals() method will evaluate to 'true' if the two expressions
				are the same and 'false' if the are not, just like the '==' operator. Please note that
				capitalization counts. In this case <strong>"yes".equals("Yes")</strong> will evaluate to
				'false'.

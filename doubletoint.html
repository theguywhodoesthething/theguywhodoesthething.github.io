    <h4>When to cast a 'double' to an 'int'</h4>
		<p>
			When dealing with numbers in Java, it is important to use the correct data type when declaring your variables. An 'int' is an integer, which is to say that it can only contain whole numbers. A 'double' is a floating point value, used when dealing with decimals. A common problem in programming occurs when calculating a mix of 'doubles' and integers. For example, if you take <strong>3 / 2 = 1.5</strong>, the 3 and 2 are both integers, but 1.5 is a decimal. If 1.5 is stored into an 'int', then it will be stored as 1, which is likely not what the programmer was looking for. You can store it as a double, but when dealing with floating point values computers often have rounding errors when repeating decimals are calculated. So when calculating <strong>1.5 x 2 = 3</strong>, a program will often come up with 3.00000000001 instead of 3. So by 'casting' the double 3.00000000001 to an 'int' you can store the answer as 3 instead. This Computerphile video on floating points has a more detailed explanation.

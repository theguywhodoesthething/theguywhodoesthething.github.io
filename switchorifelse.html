    <h4>When to use 'switch' and 'if/else'</h4>
		<p>
      In Java, there are many times when you need to create conditional statements that only execute in specific situations. The 'if' statement is used to accomplish this. For example, perhaps you want to create a program that checks a person's age. <strong>if (age>=21) {code}</strong> The code between the brackets will only run if 'age' is greater or equal to 21. The 'if' statement can be paired with an 'else' statement to create a condition that will execute if the the 'if' statement fails. For example, <strong>if (age>=21) {code A} else {code B}</strong> will execute code B if the age variable is under 21. You can create many 'if' statements in a series if you want to create lots of conditions that will be checked. The first statement that is true will the executed and then the rest will be skipped.

    <p>
      'Switch' statements can also be used to create statements that will only execute a portion of code based on a condition. The only difference is that you declare the variable that you will be checking at the beginning of the code with 'switch'. Then you list each condition with the code to execute followed by a 'break' line. End your 'switch' statement with a 'default' that will execute in the event that none of your previous conditions was met. This prevents your program from crashing. Any code that you would write with an 'if/else' statement could also be written with a 'switch' statement. One or the other may be easier and involve less written code depending on the condition that you are checking.

    <h4>When to use for, while, and do while loops</h4>
		<p>
				In Java, short snippets of programs that will run repeatedly until a condition is satisified are called a loops. Loops are very useful and widely used in computer programming and often make up the bulk of a program. There are many ways to create loops in Java, and each way has it's own advantages and disadvantages.
		</p>
		<p>
			   'For' loops are used when you know exactly how many times you want to run through your loop. The syntax used in 'for' loops is <strong>for (int i=0; i>5; i++) {code to loop}</strong>. Each conditional statement in a 'for' loop must declare an 'int' and assign it a value, then set an escape value for that 'int' when the loop will exit, and then iterate the 'int' somehow. For example, in the 'for' loop above the code will run 5 times before exiting.
		<p>
				'While' loops are useful for creating loops when you don't know how many times or even if you want your code to run. The syntax for a 'while' loop is <strong>while (condition) {code to loop}</strong>. The 'while' loop will check the condition, run, and continue to run as long as the condition in the parentheses remains 'true'. For that reason it is very important that your code evaluate to 'false' at some point otherwise your program will be stuck in an infinite loop.
			</p>
      <p>
        'Do while' loops are used when the body of your loop is assigning a value to a variable that is being checked in your run condition. The syntax of a 'do while' loop is <strong>do {code to loop} while (condition)</strong>. The advantage of a 'do while' loop is that, because the condition is checked for the first time after your code has run, you know that your code will run at least once before exiting, unlike the 'while' loop.
